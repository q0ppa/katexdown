.SYNOPSIS
Assemble the Windows distribution: the plugin plus the Qt WebEngine runtime Kate does not ship.

.DESCRIPTION
The file list is explicit rather than whatever windeployqt produces, for two reasons. windeployqt
deploys the closure a generic Qt app might need (QML debug tooling, geolocation backends, a PDF
module, a bundled VC redist installer), roughly 42 MB of which katdown never touches. And it fails
part way on a Craft layout, because it looks for the WebEngine .pak files under a resources\
subdirectory that Craft does not create.

The list has two halves, and they need different evidence.

DLLs are settled by import analysis: kept when they are a static import of Qt6WebEngineCore or
Qt6WebEngineWidgets, dropped when the plugin still resolved every import with the file absent, on a
real Kate install.

The D3D shader compilers windeployqt offers (d3dcompiler_47.dll, dxcompiler.dll, dxil.dll) are
deliberately not here. Windows ships d3dcompiler_47.dll in System32, so Chromium finds it without
help; dxcompiler.dll and dxil.dll exist in neither Craft nor Kate nor a stock Windows install, so
there is nothing to ship. Chromium falls back to software rendering when it cannot compile D3D
shaders, which is already what happens on hardware that fails GPU init.

Data files are settled ONLY by running something that renders. They are opened by name at runtime,
so a clean link, a clean `dumpbin /dependents`, and a successful `LoadLibraryExW` all stay green
with any of them missing. Two shipped as absent before a real render test caught them: the locale
pak (wrong directory) and `v8_context_snapshot.bin` (never copied at all, because windeployqt exits
1 partway through its WebEngine resources step on a Craft layout and the hand-written replacement
list did not know about it). Do not add or remove anything in the data-file half on the strength of
a load test.

Anything Kate already ships is deliberately absent: install.ps1 refuses to overwrite files it did
not put there, so a payload that duplicated Kate's own Qt would refuse to install.

.PARAMETER CraftRoot
Craft installation the files come from (the one that built the plugin).

.PARAMETER PluginDll
Path to the built katdown.dll.

.PARAMETER OutDir
Directory to assemble into. Created if absent, cleared if it already holds a payload.

.PARAMETER Zip
Optional path for a zip of the assembled tree.
